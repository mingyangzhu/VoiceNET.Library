## Introduce
This is a tool to help create a Model file for the ***VoiceNET library***
## Guide
### Step 1 - Settings
- Open ***MicBuilder*** Software
- Click ***"Settings"*** to select your dataset folder, create a new one if you don't have one.

Ambient noise reduction setting

- ***Min Value***: Adjust the minimum volume level to perform capturing. Input sound that is less than this portion will be considered noise.
- ***Continuous***: How long does the sound stay continuous when Sound Input > Min Volume. The default value is 250 milliseconds.

Click ***"Save & Close"***

### Step 2 - Monitor
- Click ***"Monitor"***
- Enter Label Name: Label names must be Latin alphabet characters, written  consecutively without spaces or special characters, and  have a maximum length of 255 characters.  Example: turnoffthecomputer, call119, closethewindows.

***Nota bene:*** In order to create a diverse dataset and reduce the rate of misidentification, you should say it 10 times at each microphone volume level from 10% or 20% to 90%. On the MicBuilder interface, adjust the Microphone Volume.

***Follow below table:***

- Start speaking content related to the entered label name until you see the captured image in the MicBuilder interface. Â Then, click "Add Image Label". Continue doing this until you have the quantity you want. Add as much data as possible and each label should have an equal number of times.

***Tip:*** multiple people's voices can be used to increase the diversity of the dataset.

When finished, click ***"x"*** to close the window

### Step 3 - Train Data
- Click ***"Train Data"***

Model creation will happen automatically, please wait until it's done. When the "Train Data" process ends, a window will be displayed for you to re-evaluate the Model by repeating the content you have labeled with the previous name. When the re-evaluation is still not good, continue to click "Monitor" to add data and re-train data.

### Final

The ***MLModel.zip*** file will be created inside your Dataset folder. Use it with the ***VoiceNET Library*** to build Voice Command Control for your software.

### Note

The maximum dataset size is 1GB according to the conventions of the ML.NET library.
